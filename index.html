            <p class="about_me_summary">I am Lynn Thompson and I have a BA Degree from UC Berkeley in Psychology and a MS from UCLA in Physiology. After graduate school I decided on a career change and took Java programming classes through UCLA Extension. I was hired by the UCLA Department of Radiology and we made an Electronic Medical Record system for Radiology clinics. 

                I have over 5 years experience with Java, MVC Spring and PostgreSQL.
